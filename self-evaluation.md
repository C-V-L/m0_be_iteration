# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `each` method?

**I feel very confident on the each method. It was one of the easier methods to grasp how it functioned AND its used case.**

- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?

**I found this concept to be very straight forward and building directly on the previous learnings. It felt really good to quickly recall the various ways we could use other methods to produce the outcome the challenges were asking for. No struggle on iterations!**

- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?

**I was able to breeze through this assingment in about 20 minutes and feel like I took away the key concepts. My adjustment will be to use the remaining time to read ahead on material.**

- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?

**All set!**
